The general design plan will be recoreded here. 

Each of the 15 forumlas will be an extension of the Forumla base class. This class will have all the 
staistical analyisis functions predefined. It will also contain the pure virtual function caclulate.
This will be implemented by each of the equations and will contain the hardcoded logic for each equation.
At program start all 15 of the equations will be instantiated into an thread pool of these forumlas. Then, as 
random populations are generated threads will be passed an index of this array. Each object
will then hold its records in an array of vectors untill the calculations are complete. Statistical anaylisis
will then be preformed on the resulting data. 

Threads will each be repsonsible for on index in array of populations. When they are ready they will set there respective index 
null signaling to the master thread that it is time to pass a new population into the index. This is shared memory paralleaztion 

Once each thread has finshed its analytics it will put a vector in the sharred array at its spot and terminate. The main thread will then run 
through and report the data
